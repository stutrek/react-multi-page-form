Managing complex, multi-step forms in React can quickly become cumbersome, especially when dealing with conditional logic, dynamic workflows, and user navigation. **react-multi-page-form** is designed to simplify this process by providing a robust framework for handling multiple page forms and dependent workflows with ease.

![How it fits in](undefined "How it fits in")

The API is simple enough to use with a two page form and scales up to forms of any size.

**Why Use React Multi Page Form?**

 • **Streamline Long Forms:** Easily skip unnecessary pages in lengthy forms based on user input, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.

 • **Simplified Navigation:** Implement next and previous buttons effortlessly, allowing users to navigate through the form without hassle.

 • **Dynamic Form Testing:** Quickly test and determine which forms are displayed to users depending on their selections, enabling tailored experiences.

 • **Resume Functionality:** Allow users to save their progress and resume the form from where they left off, enhancing usability and completion rates.

 • **Composable Workflows:** Combine multiple workflows into a single cohesive process, promoting reusability and modularity in form management.

**Integration within the Ecosystem**

**react-multi-page-form** seamlessly fits into the larger React ecosystem by focusing solely on form flow management. It does not handle UI rendering nor data persistence, allowing developers to integrate it with their preferred component libraries and state management solutions. It comes with an integration for **react-hook-form**, but it could be used with Formik, Final Form, or any other React form library.
