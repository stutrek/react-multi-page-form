Managing complex, multi-step forms can become cumbersome, especially with conditional logic, dynamic workflows, and user navigation. **react-multi-page-form** is designed to simplify this process by providing a robust framework for managing and composing multiple page forms and multiple dependent forms.

### Interactive Example

This example features a short form that displays additional pages only if the user resides in a specific state, along with optional sections and confirmation. Adjust the form data to see the sequence change.

## Integration within the Ecosystem

React Multi Page Form seamlessly integrates into the React ecosystem by focusing exclusively on sequence and flow management. It doesnâ€™t handle UI rendering or data persistence, allowing developers to pair it with their preferred component libraries and state management tools. While it includes integration with React Hook Form, it can also work with Formik, Final Form, or any other React form library.

## Why Use React Multi Page Form?

- **Streamline Long Forms:** Skip unnecessary pages dynamically based on user inputs.
- **Easy Testing:** Quickly see the list of pages used for any set of data, and render all pages at once.
- **Simplified Navigation:** Implement next and previous buttons effortlessly.
- **Resume Functionality:** Enable users to pick up where they left off, improving completion rates.
- **Composable Workflows:** Combine multiple workflows into a single cohesive process, promoting reusability and modularity in form management.
- **Great for AI:** Clear separation of concerns makes it easy for AI to generate the first draft of your sequences and forms.
