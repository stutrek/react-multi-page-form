Managing complex, multi-step forms can quickly become cumbersome, especially when dealing with conditional logic, dynamic workflows, and user navigation. **react-multi-page-form** is designed to simplify this process by providing a robust framework for managing and composing multiple page forms and multiple dependent forms.

### Interactive Example

This example features a short form that displays additional pages only if the user resides in a specific state, along with optional sections and confirmation. Adjust the form data to see the sequence change.

React Multi Page Form seamlessly integrates into the React ecosystem by focusing exclusively on sequence and flow management. It doesnâ€™t handle UI rendering or data persistence, allowing developers to pair it with their preferred component libraries and state management tools. While it includes integration with React Hook Form, it can also work with Formik, Final Form, or any other React form library.

## Why Use React Multi Page Form?

- **Streamline Long Forms:** Easily skip unnecessary pages in lengthy forms based on user input.
- **Simplified Navigation:** Implement next and previous buttons effortlessly.
- **Dynamic Form Testing:** Quickly test and determine which forms are displayed to users depending on their selections.
- **Resume Functionality:** Allow users to resume the form from where they left off, enhancing usability and completion rates.
- **Composable Workflows:** Combine multiple workflows into a single cohesive process, promoting reusability and modularity in form management.
- **Great for AI:** Clear separation of concerns makes it easy for AI to generate the first draft of your sequences and forms.
