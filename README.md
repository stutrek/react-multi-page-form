# react-multi-page-form

This is a tool for managing the sequence and flow of multi-page workflows. Given a long series of screens, it can put them in the proper order and help choose which one to show.

Workflows can be composed, allowing you to reuse parts of a flow.

## Basic Example

```ts

const data = 

const sequence = [

]

const process = useMultiPageForm()


```
